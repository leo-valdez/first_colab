# Chess Game
Chess is one of the world’s most popular and the oldest strategic board game played. Over the years many organizations and communities have taken many efforts to create a AI that calculates the best possible move for maximising it's own probability/profit to win while maximising the opponents probability to Lose.    

### Overview
This repository contains the 2-player chess and AI chess game implemented in Python programming language. In addition to this it also contains the executable files (in folders `2-Player Chess EXE` and `AI Chess EXE`) for the same so that any user can play the game without having to download Python and rest of the dependencies required to run the python scripts.
<br>
## Approach

Mini-Max Algorithm is used to search the best possible move playable by AI to maximise its own probability of winning and maximising the opponents probability of losing. Moreover the rank/weight/profit of the piece at each position of the board is used to calculate the best move. Python programming language was used to implement this. Pygame module was used for GUI, wherein user can drag pieces to play a move. Since the search algorithm is slow in finding move, so in order to speed things up the `python-chess` library (https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess) was used for the gameplay backend for getting the chess notations and possible moves. Thereby reducing the time taken for calculating users possible moves, game board updation, and played moves updation. *Significant time and resource reduction.* 
<br><br>
To run the python scripts the folowing modules need to be pre-installed:<br>
```
pip install pygame 
pip install python-chess
```
<br><br>
The ranks or the weights that the algorithm uses for searching move is as follows:

### Future Improvements:
Using Alpha-beta Pruning algorithm to further reducing time taken to search moves. Use of Reinforced Learning or a Deep Learning based approach to compute best move to be played and to achieve a high accuracy in minimum amount of time.
