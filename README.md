# Chess Game
Chess is one of the worldâ€™s most popular and the oldest strategic board game played. Over the years many organizations and communities have taken many efforts to create a AI that calculates the best possible move for maximising it's own probability/profit to win while maximising the opponents probability to Lose.    

### Overview
This repository contains the 2-player chess and AI chess game implemented in Python programming language. In addition to this it also contains the executable files (in folders `2-Player Chess EXE` and `AI Chess EXE`) for the same so that any user can play the game without having to download Python and rest of the dependencies required to run the python scripts.
<br>

### Future Improvements:
Using Alpha-beta Pruning algorithm to further reducing time taken to search moves. Use of Reinforced Learning or a Deep Learning based approach to compute best move to be played and to achieve a high accuracy in minimum amount of time.
